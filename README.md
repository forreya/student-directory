# student-directory

The student directory program allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at a school.

## How to use:

#### Run the `directory_main.rb` file

```
$ cd student-directory
$ ruby directory_main
```

## Side Notes:
- Ignore the `directory_typos.rb` & `directory.rb` file, those were used as coding practice.
- The main file to test the system is `directory_main.rb`, along with the `students.csv` file which contains the data on the students (this can be modified).
